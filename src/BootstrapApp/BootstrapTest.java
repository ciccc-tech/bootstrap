/**
 * BootStrapTest
 * 
 * Designed to test the behaviour of Bootstrap.java and serve as an example of its usage. 
 * 
 * Its a good idea to create test code for critical sections of code because it allows us to make sure
 * that the code continues to work as expected. 
 * 
 * Often things can break when we are developing in a team. 
 * 
 * TTD - This is test driven development and part of our course.
