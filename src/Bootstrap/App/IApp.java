package Bootstrap.App;

/**  
 * IApp is an interface. 
 * 
 * An interface provides a very 'thin' and minimum implementation of some code. It is very
 * much like a class but it is NOT a class, it has a different but similar purpose. 
 * 
 * You can EXTEND from a class but you can only IMPLEMENT an interface (unless you are also an interface). 
 * 
 * We will use a combination of BOTH while creating our Bootstrap application
 * 
 * This allows me to provide 'some code now' and to 'force the developer' to implement
 * some methods himself later when he uses it. 
 * 
 * It also allows me to set down rules, polices and practices but how some things should be
 * implemented and also allows me then to build systems that can rely on the 'interface' 
 * rather than the 'class' to work with something. This allows us to make general purpose code. 
 * 
 * This interface is designed to provide some minimum code to our application.
